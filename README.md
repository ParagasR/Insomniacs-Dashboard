## Insomniac's Dashboard

This is the first Project assignment for Trilogy Full-Stack Bootcamp.  

This is a Horror movie search application using HTML, CSS, Bulma Framework, JavaScript and two third party API's (TMDBA and YouTube). This application is designed to solve and execute a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.  

Insomniacâ€™s Dashboard is an application for horror fanatics that provides all horror movies with brief description, ratings, and trailer.
When the user loads into the web-app, they are presented with a countdown timer until Halloween. 
Next element presented on this application is a search bar that users can search for a desired horror movie.
All searches for desired movies will be stored and presented on a previously viewed list. 
Another essential element of this application is a current list of most popular horror movies.
